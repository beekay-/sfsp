                    <h1>Learn to invest at your own pace.</h1>
                    <p>I work with financially-savvy millennials, like you. The only problem is they are intimidated by the stock market, and missing out on building wealth through self-directed investing. Instead, they watch their hard-earned dollars sit in savings accounts, high-cost mutual funds, or robo-advisors earning small returns that are diminished further by fees. You deserve to enjoy great returns on your money, receive steady passive income, and create lifetime wealth and financial security for yourself. The Six-Figure Stock Portfolio program teaches you how.

                    I bet you’re dying to start investing, but some big fears are holding you back. For example, do you ever:</p>

                    <ul class="flex">
                        <li class="coin">Think you don’t have enough money or time to invest?</li>
                        <li class="coin">Feel so overwhelmed by the complexity and volatility of the stock market?</li>
                        <li class="coin">Struggle to know how to build a portfolio with great returns?</li>
                        <li class="coin">Find yourself staying away because you’re too scared to even try investing?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If any of the above sounds like you, you’re not alone. Most young people want to take a bigger role in managing their own investments, but they don't know where to begin. Instead, they're left wondering if the portfolio they're currently using is really right for them, or worse, leave their money in savings account and miss out on the returns they need to become financially secure and fund the life of their dreams.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="card flex bottom-margin-fix">

                    <h1>Imagine that, instead of working so hard for your money, you could make your money work for you.</h1>

                    <p>You can use the stock market to create a steady passive income stream and build lifelong-wealth that will ensure financial security for the rest of your life&mdash;starting right now. There has never been a better time to start building wealth through investing.

                    If you ever want to reach financial freedom, you’ll need to earn more than 1% on you money in a savings account. Now is your opportunity to lay the financial foundation for the life you want, by creating an investment portfolio that earns you money and keeps your hard-earned dollars safe.

                    Let me show you how.</p>

                    <h1>FAQs</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Is this course for Americans or Canadians?
                        <span class="normal">Both! I’m Canadian, but I invest in Canadian, US, and international stocks&mdash;and I show you how to do the same. Most of the investing information in this eCourse can be used regardless of what country you reside in, but when things pop up that are different (for example, RRSPs vs. 401K’s!) I’ve split sections to be country specific. I’ve got you covered no matter what side of the border you call home.</span>
                        </li>

                        <li>How is this course different from other investing books or online classes?
                        <span class="normal">I built this course using my MBA in Finance and personal investing experience. It’s a mix of the standard information you’ll find everywhere (ie. The definition of a stock or bond) plus my personal strategies developed exclusively for young investors that you can’t find anywhere else. This is the only comprehensive online resource that guides AND educates you through creating a $100,000 investment portfolio that meets YOUR personal investment goals.</span>
                        </li>

                        <li>Do you provide stock recommendations in this course?
                        <span class="normal">My main goal in the Build a Six-Figure Stock Portfolio program is to teach YOU how to recognize a good investment for yourself. Personal finance is personal, and that is especially true of your stock portfolio. I won’t tell you what to buy, but I will disclose what securities I’m investing in and give you the skills you need to select the investments you need to meet your goals.</span>
                        </li>

                        <li>I’m already using LearnVest/WealthBar/Wealth Simple or have a financial advisor, is this course still for me?
                        <span class="normal">Yes! If you signed up for a robo-advising service or have a financial advisor, I already know you’re passionate about investing and ready to get started. But do you know how your money is being invested? Robo-advisors are great for people who want completely hands-off portfolios, but if you’re interested in keeping costs low by minimizing fees, doing more than “set it and forget it”, and taking control of your wealth, the Six-Figure Stock Portfolio investing program will teach you how. This course is a complement to any investment strategies and resources you currently have in place.</span>
                        </li>

                        <li>Why does the course cost $379 USD?
                        <span class="normal">The Six-Figure Stock Portfolio eCourse is the most important investment you’ll ever make when it comes to the stock market: because it’s the one that teaches you how to invest. You’re here because you care about your money, and you don’t let it go easily. But you also understand how quickly you can lose money when you don’t know what you’re doing. My goal with The Six-Figure Stock Portfolio investing program is to provide you with a practical investing education, for less than the price of a single university finance class. Knowing how to invest safely and profitably will generate a return of tens of thousands of dollars, even hundreds of thousands of dollars, in your investing lifetime.

                        The price of the course includes all taxes and fees. Canadians do not have to pay any additional GST/HST.</span>
